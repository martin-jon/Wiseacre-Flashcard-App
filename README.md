codeLouisville FSJS Student Project:
Wiseacre-Flashcard-App

To install:
First, go to the root directory of the project in terminal. Next, run ‘npm install'. You should see the node_modules folder added in the root directory. (I added Bower as a post-install via npm, so you should also see the client/lib folder popluated. If not, then run ‘bower install’).
Open a new tab in your terminal and run ‘mongod'. In the other tab run ‘npm start’. Go to http://localhost:3000 to open the application.

Enter a flashcard question and answer, along with a category tag. To test create 5 flashcards in total. When complete, simply click the ‘Start the Quiz’ button.
